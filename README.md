CD+G (CD + Graphics) is a binary format for displaying graphics when playing a music CD. It is widely used for Karaoke.

There exist several [CD+G players and CD+G authoring tools](CDGTools.md). The latter allow for creating and manipulating CD+G files. However, most of them are commercial products and only available for Microsoft Windows.

The objective of this project is to implement cross-platform tools for processing CD+G files.
